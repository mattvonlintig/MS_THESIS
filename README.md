# MS_THESIS
Functions and code associated with my Geophysics MS thesis. Codes include reading and processing infrasound time series data, volcanic signal detection using the Fisher statistic, and statistical analysis of volcanic repose intervals.
Infrasound data was stored locally, so please disregard any and all scripts and functions that deal with loading data into Matlab. This is a WORK IN PROGRESS as I find everything and eventually get it working again. Thanks!
